# ZPSUTIL

ZPSUtil is a library containing various functions and callbacks which plugin developers can use to simplify their code.

# Sourcemod Version Requirements
Compiled binaries in the releases zip file are compiled with Sourcemod **1.11.6858**. You can get it here: https://www.sourcemod.net/downloads.php?branch=dev

For Sourcemod 1.10 you also require dhooks (https://forums.alliedmods.net/showpost.php?p=2588686&postcount=589). Keep in mind that as of 1.11.6820 dhooks is part of sourcemod hence you do not need to seperately download it if you run 1.11.6820 or higher.

# Linux Only
This utility plugin is only supported on linux. If you need windows signatures / offsets that is up to you to figure out!
